Installation instructions
-------------------------

You will need to install a few dependencies before executing the script:

```python
pip3 install -U beautifulsoup4
pip3 install -U requests
pip3 install -U fake-useragent
```
Now you need to run the following:

`python pattern-finder.py` / `python3 pattern-finder.py` (the latter if you are using Python 3 via Homebrew on Mac OS)
