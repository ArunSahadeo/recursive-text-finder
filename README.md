Installation instructions
-------------------------

You will need to install a few dependencies before executing the script:

```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

If that doesn't work, try this:

```python
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
```

The `--user` specifies your home directory

For Arch Linux:

```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Or:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you need to run the following:

`python pattern-finder.py` / `python3 pattern-finder.py` (the latter if you are using Python 3 via Homebrew on Mac OS)
